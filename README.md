# MUNGCRAFT: REQUIEM

_**MUNGCRAFT: REQUIEM**_ is a modpack that allows you to explore and colonize a beautiful atmospheric world. However, this world won’t sit idly by and let you prosper. A linear boss progression system means you're going to have to fight to move forward. Stronger and smarter enemies mean this will be harder than ever.

>Requiem is a purpose-built modpack. Many recipes have been changed and a guidebook has been added to ensure you always know what to do next.

## Combat

Combat has been completely reworked in Requiem. Each weapon has been given its own unique animation and 
swing patterns. A plethora new medieval-themed weapons and armor ensure that you’ll have no shortage of weapons to test this out on.

## Progression

A linear progression system has been added with ***_*9*_*** required bosses in total before you're able to reach the end. As you fight your way through various dimensions the Overworld will grow more difficult in response, with harder enemies being released in every stage of progression.

## Minecolonies

You won't be able to survive the world of Requiem alone. Build a kingdom filled with citizens of all walks of life to ensure you won't have to. From resource gathering to building grand structures, colonists serve a variety of purposes.

## Create

Along with combative progression comes technological. Innovation is key in staying alive in a scrappy world, build grand contraptions or smelt down iron into steel so that you always have an edge.
